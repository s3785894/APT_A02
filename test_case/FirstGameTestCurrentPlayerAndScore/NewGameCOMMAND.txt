/*Test that first players token goes to player Spring's floor line when taking from 0 factory in TakeFirstPlayerToken.txt. When the round ends, the expected result is in NewGameExpected.txt. Alice has score of 2 for placing 2 tiles in mosaic. Spring has score of 2 for playing 3 tiles in mosaic and minus 1 score for the first player token in floor line

In the expected file at the end of the round, Spring's boolean of whether it is their turn should be true, since she has the first player token
